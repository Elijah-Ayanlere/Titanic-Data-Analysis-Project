## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. You can use pip to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Download the Titanic dataset and place it in an appropriate directory. Update the file path in the script accordingly.

2. Run the script to perform data analysis and visualization.

```
python titanic_analysis.py
```

## Conclusion

This analysis of the Titanic dataset provides insights into the survival rates based on different features such as gender, class, age, fare, and embarked location. Visualizations help in understanding the data better and identifying patterns that might not be obvious from raw data.
